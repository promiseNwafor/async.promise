# Resolving: [Integration Challenge]

*Opening hook about the specific challenge you're solving*

## The Problem

Clear description of the integration challenge developers face.

## Why This Matters

The impact of not solving this problem properly.

## The Naive Approach (Anti-Pattern)

```typescript
// What doesn't work and why
const badApproach = async () => {
  // Example of problematic code
};
```

## The Production-Ready Solution

```typescript
// Robust, tested approach
const robustSolution = async () => {
  try {
    // Proper implementation with error handling
  } catch (error) {
    // Graceful degradation
  }
};
```

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: [First Step]
Detailed explanation with code examples

### Step 2: [Second Step]  
More implementation details

### Step 3: [Final Step]
Wrap-up and final considerations

## Common Pitfalls

- **Pitfall 1**: Description and how to avoid
- **Pitfall 2**: Another common mistake
- **Pitfall 3**: Yet another issue to watch for

## Testing Strategy

How to test this integration:

```typescript
describe('AI Integration', () => {
  it('should handle success cases', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should gracefully handle failures', async () => {
    // Error case testing
  });
});
```

## Monitoring and Observability

What to monitor in production:
- Response times
- Error rates
- Cost metrics
- Quality indicators

## Real-World Results

Performance improvements or lessons learned from implementing this solution.
