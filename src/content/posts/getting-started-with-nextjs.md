# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 represents one of the most significant updates to the popular React framework. With the stable App Router and numerous performance improvements, it's an excellent time to dive into modern web development with Next.js.

## What's New in Next.js 14

The latest version of Next.js brings several exciting features:

### App Router (Stable)
The App Router is now stable and provides a more intuitive way to structure your applications. It uses React Server Components by default, offering better performance and developer experience.

### Turbopack (Alpha)
Turbopack, the Rust-based bundler, is now available in alpha for local development, providing up to 53% faster cold starts.

### Server Actions
Server Actions allow you to run server-side code directly from your components, simplifying form handling and data mutations.

## Setting Up Your First Next.js 14 Project

Getting started is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This command creates a new Next.js project with:
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- App Router structure

## Project Structure

The new App Router introduces a different file structure:

```
src/
  app/
    layout.tsx      # Root layout
    page.tsx        # Home page
    globals.css     # Global styles
    blog/
      page.tsx      # Blog listing page
      [slug]/
        page.tsx    # Dynamic blog post page
```

## Key Concepts

### Layouts
Layouts are shared UI components that wrap multiple pages. They're perfect for navigation, headers, and footers.

### Server Components
By default, components in the App Router are Server Components, which render on the server and can directly access databases and APIs.

### Client Components
Use the `'use client'` directive when you need interactivity, browser APIs, or React hooks.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when necessary
2. **Leverage the file-system router** - Organize your routes using folders and files
3. **Optimize images** - Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
4. **Implement proper SEO** - Use metadata API for better search engine optimization

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 offers a powerful and modern approach to building web applications. The App Router provides a more intuitive development experience while maintaining excellent performance characteristics.

Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application, Next.js 14 provides the tools and flexibility you need to create amazing user experiences.
