## The Async Nature

How this relates to the async/promise paradigm in development:

```javascript
// Current workflow
const solution = await currentApproach(problem);

// Future workflow with new AI tool
const aiSolution = await newAITool.process(problem);
const refinedSolution = await human.review(aiSolution);
```

## Timeline and Expectations
