# Catching: [AI Limitation or Reality Check]

*Hook about a specific AI limitation or overpromise you're examining*

## The Promise vs Reality

```javascript
// What was promised
const marketingPromise = await ai.solveEverything(vagueRequirements);

// What actually happens
try {
  const attempt = await ai.try(complexProblem);
  const reality = await human.fixAndImprove(attempt);
} catch (limitation) {
  console.log("Human expertise required");
}
```

## Where AI Consistently Struggles

### [Specific Area 1]
- Why AI struggles here
- Examples of failures
- What humans do better

### [Specific Area 2]  
- Technical limitations
- Real-world examples
- Human advantages

### [Specific Area 3]
- Fundamental constraints
- Why this is unlikely to change soon

## The Hype vs Reality

Common misconceptions about AI capabilities:

1. **Misconception**: AI can replace domain experts
   **Reality**: AI amplifies experts but can't replace deep knowledge

2. **Misconception**: AI always improves with more data
   **Reality**: Quality matters more than quantity

3. **Misconception**: AI is objective and unbiased
   **Reality**: AI reflects the biases in its training data

## Case Study: When AI Failed

Detailed example of an AI implementation that didn't work as expected:

- Initial expectations
- What went wrong
- Lessons learned
- How to avoid similar issues

## The Human Advantage

What humans bring that AI cannot:

- **Contextual understanding**
- **Creative problem solving**
- **Ethical reasoning**
- **Intuitive leaps**

## Building Realistic AI Workflows

```typescript
interface RealisticAIWorkflow {
  aiSuggestion: string;
  humanReview: boolean;
  fallbackPlan: string;
  qualityGate: (output: any) => boolean;
}

const balancedApproach = async (problem: Problem) => {
  const aiAttempt = await ai.process(problem);
  
  if (!qualityGate(aiAttempt)) {
    return await humanExpert.handle(problem);
  }
  
  return await humanExpert.review(aiAttempt);
};
```

## Setting Proper Expectations

How to think about AI capabilities realistically:

- Understand the training data limitations
- Recognize domain-specific challenges  
- Plan for edge cases and failures
- Maintain human oversight

## The Balanced Perspective

AI is a powerful tool, not a silver bullet. The key is:

- Use AI where it excels
- Keep humans in the loop for critical decisions
- Plan for graceful degradation
- Learn from both successes and failures
