# Async AI: [Design Pattern or Architecture Topic]

*Introduction to the architectural challenge this pattern solves*

## The Challenge

Description of the specific problem this pattern addresses in AI-first applications.

## Traditional Approaches

How this was typically handled before AI:

```typescript
// Traditional approach
class TraditionalSolution {
  solve(problem: Problem): Solution {
    // Synchronous, deterministic approach
    return this.process(problem);
  }
}
```

## The AI-First Pattern

```typescript
// AI-enhanced pattern
class AIFirstPattern {
  private ai: AIService;
  private fallback: FallbackService;
  private validator: Validator;

  async solve(problem: Problem): Promise<Solution> {
    try {
      const aiSolution = await this.ai.process(problem);
      
      if (await this.validator.isValid(aiSolution)) {
        return aiSolution;
      }
      
      return await this.fallback.process(problem);
    } catch (error) {
      return await this.handleFailure(problem, error);
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Component 1: [Core Component]
Detailed explanation of the first key component

### Component 2: [Supporting Component]
How the supporting elements work

### Component 3: [Integration Layer]
How everything connects together

## Real-World Example

Concrete implementation scenario:

```typescript
// Practical example
class [SpecificImplementation] implements [Pattern] {
  // Full working example with proper types
}
```

## Variations and Adaptations

### Variation 1: [Alternative Approach]
When to use this variation

### Variation 2: [Another Option]
Different use cases and tradeoffs

## Testing Strategy

How to test async AI patterns:

```typescript
describe('[Pattern Name]', () => {
  it('should handle AI success', async () => {
    // Test successful AI path
  });
  
  it('should fallback gracefully', async () => {
    // Test fallback mechanisms
  });
  
  it('should validate outputs', async () => {
    // Test validation logic
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

- Latency implications
- Cost optimization
- Scalability factors
- Resource management

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Not planning for failures**: Always have fallbacks
2. **Ignoring costs**: Monitor and optimize API usage
3. **Over-engineering**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
4. **Poor validation**: Always validate AI outputs

## Related Patterns

How this pattern connects to:
- [Related Pattern 1]
- [Related Pattern 2]
- [Related Pattern 3]

## When to Use This Pattern

Guidelines for when this pattern is appropriate:
- Problem characteristics
- Team capabilities
- Technical constraints
- Business requirements

## Migration Strategy

How to adopt this pattern in existing systems:

1. **Phase 1**: Add alongside existing code
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually migrate use cases
3. **Phase 3**: Full adoption and optimization
